Overview 
 
The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized 
way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. 
 
Key Features of this Python SDK 
● Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server 
● Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts, and tools 
● Use standard transports like stdio and SSE 
● Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events 
MCP Primitives 
The MCP protocol defines three core primitives that servers can implement: 
Primitive Control Description Example Use 
Prompts User-controlled Interactive templates 
invoked by user choice 
Slash commands, 
menu options 
Resources Application-contro
lled 
Contextual data 
managed by the client 
application 
File contents, API 
responses 
Tools Model-controlled Functions exposed to 
the LLM to take 
actions 
API calls, data
